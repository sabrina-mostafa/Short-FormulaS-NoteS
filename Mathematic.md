## Series : 
    1) 1+2+3+4+5+....+n = (n*(n+1) )/2
    
    2) x^0+x^1+x^2+.... = (1-x)^-1
    
    3) Set length of 15 has >> 2^15 Subsets 

## Perfect Square :
    1. How do you find the number of perfect squares in a range?
       >> We take ceil of sqrt(a) because we need to consider numbers after a. For example, let b = 24, a = 8.
          floor(sqrt(b)) = 4, ceil(sqrt(a)) = 3
          And number of squares is (4 - 3 + 1) = 2.
