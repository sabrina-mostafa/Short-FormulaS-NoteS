## Square :
    1. Diagonal of a Square = a*âˆš(2)
    
## Circle :
    1. Check if two circles intersect :
    
        D = distance btwn two centers,
        Sum_R = Sum of radius1 and radius2 
        
        i. if D>Sum_R  ~~~do not intesect
       ii. if D<Sum_R  ~~~intersect in two points
      iii. if D=Sum_R ~~~two circles touch

## Straight Line :
      1. slope of a line = (x1-x2)/(y1-y2) 
      2. Distance betwn two points = sqrt( (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 )
